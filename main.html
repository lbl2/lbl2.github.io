      <p>I'm Lillian, and I come bearing loads both distributed and concentrated.</p>
      <p>I am a Civil and Environmental Engineering undergraduate at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
         with a minor in Computer Science. I am slightly obsessed with 3D-printed concrete, a side effect of my being part 
         of the Lange Research Group, where I am developing a Matlab-based image stitching software for the analysis 
         of concrete pore structure. I also help to mix and test concrete mixes on a weekly basis.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I can be found at the gym, reading, or trying to recreate Malaysian dishes that I miss. 
         If you are fortunate, you might even stumble upon me fangirling over Homer, Jane Austen or anime.</p>
